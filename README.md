# SemanticHTMLConversion

## Challenge 1

There was one main challenge in this exercise. Designed to prepare students for github and deployment.

### Challenge Type

The Challenge was the following:

Receive a starter code and modify and save changes throughout.

 **Important**: For this assignment it was important that students created a new repo and DID NOT include the `Develop` folder itself, only the contents of the `Develop` folder.

 * **User Story**: This Challenge was an exercise not only where I wanted to get associated and comfortable with HTML Semantic elements but mainly to get used to pushing to GitHub and then Deploying it as well. This Challenge was necessary and I wanted to make sure that every big change I made was committed and eventually push so that deployment was up and running as intended.
